The JavaScript Advanced course extends the skills gained in the <a href="https://softuni.bg/courses/javascript-fundamentals">JavaScript Fundamentals course</a> with more complex concepts and principles from functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP) with JavaScript, as well as using DOM to process elements in a web page. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (modern JavaScript is being studied with ES2017).

The course starts by studying the object model of a browser (DOM and BOM) and interacting with it from JavaScript: searching, editing and deleting DOM tree elements, event processing, interaction with the web browser.

In-depth study of functions and paradigms from functional programming (FP): function as object, functional expressions, higher order functions, IIFE, JS objects and JSON, object composition, higher order functions, closure, JS templates such as revealing module, prototype object inheritance and prototype chain, work with generators and iterators.

Objective-oriented programming (OOP) with JavaScript classes: class defining, constructors, properties and methods, class inheritance, antitype chains, polymorphism, other types of OOP and inheritance are discussed. Serious attention is paid to unit testing and its application in software engineering to build quality software.

Module systems such as ES6 modules, CommonJS, RequireJS and module dependency management, transpellers such as Babel, error handling and exception handling, and established practices and templates for writing quality and reusable JavaScript code.

The course is highly focused on practice, with a huge number of class exercises, a practical team project and a practical exam. The tasks of the exercises and exams are evaluated automatically with the online judging system.

The course ends with a practical JavaScript exam for functional and OOP programming and DOM with automated assessment with an online judging system.

The course is part of the complete program with JavaScript courses and tutorials for the <a href="https://softuni.bg/professions/javascript">JavaScript developer</a> training at the University of Software.
